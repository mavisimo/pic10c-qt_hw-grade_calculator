# Qt Grade Calculator
PIC10C Assignment 2 - familiarizing with `Qt`, `Qt Designer`, and `Qt Creator`

Implement a Qt GUI that computes grades for two different classes PIC10B and PIC 10C each with two different grading schemes given a set of homework and exam scores.

For PIC10B with 7 HW assignments, 2 midterms, 1 final:
- 25% Homework + 20% Midterm 1 + 20% Midterm 2 + 35% Final
- 25% Homework + 30% Highest Midterm + 45% Final
- lowest homework score is dropped for both schemes

For PIC10C with 7 HW assignments, 1 midterm, 1 project, 1 final:
- 15% Homework + 25% Midterm + 30% Final Project + 30% Final
- 15% Homework + 50% Final Project + 35% Final
- lowest homework score is dropped for both schemes
